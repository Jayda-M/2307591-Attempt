                My strongest emotion, appreciation, significantly impacts my academic life. I am deeply grateful to my parents for their support and sacrifices, which inspires me to excel in school.

            Watching television, including movies, series, and documentaries, significantly impacts my academic life. This hobby broadens my knowledge by exposing me to various cultures, languages, social dynamics, and historical events. 
			It enhances my critical thinking skills as I analyze complex narratives and characters, which translates to better problem-solving abilities in my studies.
			Television also offers diverse perspectives, helping me appreciate different opinions and ideas, which is crucial for group projects and research. Additionally, watching TV serves as a valuable stress relief tool, 
			allowing me to unwind and recharge, which helps maintain my focus and productivity. 
			Overall, this hobby enriches my academic experience by providing a broader understanding of the world, improving my analytical skills, and offering a necessary balance between work and relaxation.

                <h4> <p> </br> </br> </br> "If you lose your curiosity then you stop learning." - Katherine Johnson </p></p> </h4> </br> </br>
				
				</br> </br>
                <p> A person that I really look up to is Katherine Johnson. She was an American mathematician and has worked in NASA for 35 years where her calculations in orbital mechanism were critical for the success of United States’ first crewed spaceflight mission.
                    Katherine has also worked on trajectories, launch windows and emergency return paths for Mercury’s spaceflight project. In 2015, US President Barack Obama awarded Katherine with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. 
					In 2016, she also received the Silver Snoopy Award by NASA astronaut Leland D. Melvin. I chose Katherine Johnson because she was an exceptional mathematician and activist who greatly contributed to space history whilst overcoming and speaking up against discrimination.

                <h2> <i> <b> Personality Test </b> </i> </h2>
                <p>I used the <a href="https://sakinorva.net/functions" target="_blank">Sakinorva Cognitive Functions Test</a> to assess myself.</p> 
                <p>"The Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a personality test featuring sixteen personality types and eight corresponding cognitive functions. Each personality type has dominant, auxiliary, tertiary, and inferior functions 
				that can inform how a person relates to the inner world and external world and approaches decision-making and problem-solving." </p>

                <p> In my opinion, the Sakinorva test is one of the more accurate Myers-Briggs Type Indicator personality tests. It consists of ninety-six questions about your thoughts and feelings regarding certain situations, 
				taking into account cognitive functions and how the person taking the quiz uses and values these functions. My result was INTJ, which stands for "introverted, intuitive, thinking, judging."
				The cognitive functions for the INTJ MBTI type are Ni-Te-Fi-Se. </p>
                <p>Personality, however, cannot be fully described by taking an online test, and people cannot be assorted into categories based on them. This tool, nonetheless, can give takers an idea of the different ways people think, 
				including themselves. It is key to note that people may deviate from the expectations of their personality type and that these categorizations are not absolute.</p>
